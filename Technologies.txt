  Game
    Engine
        PixiJS - Provides WebGL/HTML5 Canvas framework. Used for all graphics and creation. Allows native JS. Doesn't support 3d.
        Unity - Well tested game engine that supports webgl. Requires licensing. but has tons of documentation and assests. Could allow easy non webbrowser mode.
        ThreeJS - Same thing as pixijs but it's for 3d applications. Not as fast as pixijs
    Animations
        Spline (Dragonbones) - Allows for easier custom animations to be called, more robust then spritesheets
            http://pixijs.io/examples/#/spine/dragon.js
        Spritesheets - Basic animations that is tried and true
    Networking
      Primus - Socket Abstraction layer that allows us to change what we use for sockets without changing code. We can test any socket framework we want
        NODE WS - From brief research it is supposed to be the fastest implementation of sockets
        Socket.io - A tried and true socket method

Language

Native Javascript with ES6 
  Pro
      Tried and true javascript
      Full control over everything we do
      Tons of documentation on everything we want to do is online already
  Cons
      Becomes significantly more complex with a larger player base
      ???
      
Typescript
  Pro
      Cleaner scripting
      Static Typing/Improvements to help the project grow larger
  Cons
      Makes debuging more difficult
      Possibility of errors in compiling
      Does it play well with our libraries?
      Have to learn typescript/convert javascript exampels to typescript
